            <h5>With so many different sports cars on the market it may be difficult to understand what to look for in your choice of car.<br>Here's a guide on what to look for:</h5>

            <p class="MazdaTopic"><span class="MazdaTitle">Budgeting:</span><br>
                With most first time buyers being on a tight budget, it may seem impossible to find the perfect driving machine for under twenty or even ten thousand dollars. 
                This isn't the case for some of the older sports cars such as the <span class="carnames">Nissan 370z</span> which can be found on the market for around 
                <span class="money">$6500</span>, furthermore, these older cars have a lower maintainance cost due to their parts being less exclusive and rare to find today compared to ever before, 
                that also causes the insurance pricing for these cars to stumble and steeply decline. This may have its downsides as well as most older cars have finished their life cycle and its parts like the engine may start to show major wear or fail if it isn't cared for correctly.
                Although this may be the case with most cars it is important that you must do your own research as all cars including cars from the same model may differ 
                to each other depending on the conditions it has faced before hand.</p>

            <p class="VWTopic"><span class="VWTitle">Customisabilty:</span><br>
           Customisabilty may seem like a really big word but all it really means is how customisable something is, in this case, your sports car. 
           Sports cars are built for community customisation, that's what creates its pure uniqueness and many of these cars have their own fan clubs. 
           Although this may seem to be completely irrelevent to buying the car in the first place but it actually plays a major role in the length of the connection between you and your car.
           These clubs are full of people that can guide you on how to do anything you want to the car, may that be to completely mod it out or to keep it as mint as possible, it doesn't matter. 
           Whatever you need they most likely have it already.
