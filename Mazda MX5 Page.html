                            Most of the first time buyers of cars have very strict
                            budgets and look for a car which can get them from
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">'Point A to Point B'</span> so they buy cars that are very cheap 
                            and reliable. But that doesn't capture the experience and 
                            the essence of having an amazing time with a car,
                            Investing a bit more of your money can really boost your 
                            experience and enjoyment of your first car, an 
                            Example of this could be to, instead of buying a 
                           Mazda 2 which can be found for an average price 
                            of <span class="money">$17670</span>, you could save up another <span class="money">$6200</span> to 
                            get a faster, more exciting and overall a more

                            Reliability is a very important aspect to look at when looking
                             for any type of first car, no matter the budget since this is 
                             where the majority of the money will be spent other than fuel, 
                             this is equally or the most important aspect to look at for a sporty 
                             first car, as most of these cars are built with tuning and customisation 
                             in mind, but their are some outliers in the sporty category, one of 
                             which is the <span class="carnames">Volkswagen Golf GTI Mk7</span> produced from 2013 to 2020. This German car 
                             has been held as one of the best, cheap performance hatchbacks of all 
                             time and it' reliability score of 90.4% on What Car? Makes it one of 
                             the most reliable sports cars available for under <span class="money">$20,000</span>.
