                            The Mazda MX-5 is one of the most well recognised cars of all time, from its beginnings in 1989 to the present day, 
                            the MX-5, more commonly called the Miata, has been a crucial part of car culture mainly throughout the JDM modification scene. 
                            Throughout its over 30 years of manufacturing and three different redesigns, the car has spiritually been unchanged since 1989. 
                            Throughout its manufacturing the MX-5 remains tiny, lightweight and most importantly rear-wheel drive. 
                            Although tweaked and tuned, they continue the MX-5 with almost the same Inline 4, a Convertible top, and only two seats between its axles,
                            keeping the car simple, exciting and affordable. This is the key driver to it becoming the best-selling roadster of all time a few years back.</p></td>

                            The Original Designs for the MX-5 from Japan were going to see the MX-5 become a counter to Toyota's MR2 which came out a few years earlier. 
                            They later settled on the American designs to have the car be a RWD with an Inline 4 in the front. 
                            It was then shown of at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show, its engine producing 116hp from its 1.6L engine but the most staggering feature the car had was its extreme lightness which was unheard of in the 90's. 
                            The car was solely produced with a 5 Speed Manual Transmission with power windows and aluminium wheels being optional, the car originally came out in Red, Blue and White but they later added a Metallic Silver to the set. 
                            
                            
                            This generation lasted for almost a decade, being replaced by the modern MX-5, 
                            powered by a similar 2.0L engine to the one used in the 3rd Gen except producing only 155hp but the lightness of this car makes it the quickest MX-5 yet!

                            Although the car had amazing performance specs, it was very limited in space as many reported the center console to being too small and similar problems were heard about the cars trunk as well. 
                            Even with these massive downsides, the car was a sensation in dealerships across the globe. In 1999 the first redesign for the MX-5 was launched, even with a similar body size the 2nd Gen MX-5 boasted a massive 140hp from its updated 1.8L engine. 
                            This set the scene for the 3rd Gen MX-5 to go Modern in 2006 boasting 170hp from its improved 2.0L engine, 
                            this MX-5 finally have powered windows included in the base model with staggering improvements to the cars dials and the inclusion of a display from a BMW 3 Series.

                            The third generation lasted for almost a decade before being replaced by the modern MX-5, powered by a similar 2.0L engine to the one used in the 3rd Gen except producing only 155hp but the lightness of this car makes it the quickest MX-5 yet! It has tried to correct many of the flaws in the previous generations, some of these being the increase in trunk space, center console space and passenger space and yet the car is almost the exact same size as the 3rd Gen!
